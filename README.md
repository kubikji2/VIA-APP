# VIA-APP
Repository for semestral work for VIA.

## Main description of APP
I intend to create an app (aggregator) for comparison computer game prices from various online-shops including but not limited to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com), [GOG](https://www.gog.com/).
User can search for game by name, app then aggregate results from the online shops and show games of similar name. 
For each game, the prices with links to online shops are shown accompanied by single thumbnail of the product.
Games can be sorted by price, alphabetically or by similirity to name querry (Levenstein distance).
Each game can also be saved to wishlist using cookies for long-term price tracking.
