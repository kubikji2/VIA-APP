# VIA-APP
This repository has been created for semestral work required by course [VIA](https://sites.google.com/a/via.felk.cvut.cz/via/) taught on FEE CTU in Prague.

## Main description of APP
I intend to create an app (aggregator) for comparison computer game prices from various online-shops, including but not limited to [Steam](https://store.steampowered.com/), [Humble Bundle](https://www.humblebundle.com), [GOG](https://www.gog.com/).
Users can search for a game by name, the app then aggregate results from the online shops and show games of a similar name. 
For each game, the prices with links to online shops are shown accompanied by a single thumbnail of the product.
Games can be sorted by price, alphabetically, or by similarity to name query (Levenstein distance).
Each game can also be saved to wishlist using cookies for long-term price tracking.
